# Double-Player-Board-Game
[Inspired by Chris Deleon's "Hands On Intro To Game Programming"](https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game/learn/), developed a double-player version of the Board Game.

Are you feeling confused because you don't know how to start 'Game Development'??? Then follow Chris Deleon's "Hands On Intro To Game Programming" on Udemy. Even though I have already developed a couple of game in Java, his insights were very useful and use of `JavaScript` and `canvas` to develop a game makes it so much fun.

After the Course, I made this Board game. This is a `double-player` version, which uses `keyboard` events to run the game.

## Controls 
### Player 1
`w` - Paddle Up
`s` - Paddle Down

### Player 2
`UP` - Paddle Up
`DOWN` - Paddle Down

## How to start the file???
Unlike previous `Java` game I developed, you do not require any `Java` setup. Instead download the the `html` file or copy and paste the content into a file and save it with `.html` extension. Immediately `Magic` starts :)

## Want to Contribute???
I am also looking to develop it further more...`Adding Levels`, providing user to `customise` the difficulty options.
